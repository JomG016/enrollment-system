            <div class="scrollcontent custom-scroll">
             Carmen National High School was established on June 30, 1978 through the collective efforts of the members of the Sangguniang Bayan, spearheaded by Mr. Renato Cabacungan, the dynamic school head at that time. Strong support was extended by then Mayor Francisco Ramirez, who provided significant leadership and encouragement to the group working toward the establishment of a secondary school for the benefit of the Carmenian community and neighboring areas. Mr. Laureano Candelaria likewise rendered invaluable and unwavering support in the founding of the school.
Carmen National High School was the last barangay high school approved by the former Director of the Department of Education, Region III, Mr. Robinson Ylagan. During its initial years, the salaries of the teachers were funded by former Mayor Francisco Ramirez. The school began operations offering only first- and second-year levels, with an initial enrollment of seventy-eight (78) students.
Upon its opening, the school was temporarily housed within the compound of Carmen Elementary School. Several individuals expressed interest in leading the newly established institution; however, in the interest of the school, its students, and the community, former Mayor Ramirez and Mr. Renato Cabacungan agreed that the most dedicated and capable individual should be appointed. Consequently, Mr. Renato Cabacungan, then Principal of Carmen Elementary School, was designated as Assistant Principal under the supervision of the Principal of its mother school, Zaragoza National High School.
The pioneering teachers of the school were Mrs. Epifania G. Caparas, Miss Minda C. Gallardo, Mrs. Julieta E. Morales, Mrs. Leonora L. Ledesma, Mrs. Juliana B. Bernardino, Mrs. Felicidad D.C. Carlos, Mrs. Elenita Vanzuela, Mr. Rizaldy Santiago, Mr. Romeo Siblag, and Mr. Norberto M. Calma. Serving as honorary English teachers were Mr. Renato Cabacungan, Mr. Godofredo Galvan, Mr. Antonio Padunan, Mrs. Julieta E. Mendez, and Mrs. Arceli Candelaria. By School Year 1979–1980, all year levels of the secondary school were fully established.
As the years passed, student enrollment steadily increased, necessitating the hiring of additional teaching staff. In 1987, Mrs. Nila Mactal was appointed School Principal, followed by Mr. Quirino Guevarra, an English Division Supervisor, who served as Officer-in-Charge. From 1989 to 1994, Mrs. Gloria Gabriel, Assistant Principal of Zaragoza National High School, assumed the role of Officer-in-Charge.
When the school became a provincial high school, teachers were tasked with collecting tuition fees from students to fund their salaries. In many cases, payment was deferred until after harvest seasons, reflecting the economic realities of the community. Shortly thereafter, the Nationalization Act for all secondary schools in the Philippines was implemented.
Subsequently, plans were made to transfer the school to its permanent site, where it currently stands. A 5,700-square-meter lot was generously donated by the philanthropic Tecson family. The relocation process was challenging, as teachers and students worked together to clear the land, which was initially occupied by several residential structures. Former Mayor Lydia R. Pagaduan played a crucial role in facilitating negotiations and persuading occupants to relocate for the greater good of present and future students from Carmen and nearby communities. Voluntary contributions were also collected to assist families in transferring to other locations, paving the way for the construction of the school buildings now known as Carmen National High School.
Over the years, the school has been led by a succession of dedicated and dynamic principals, namely: Mrs. Nenita E. Masibay, Dr. Monica Mallari, Miss Leonila E. Jacinto, Dr. Elpidia R. Andres, Mr. Norberto M. Calma, Mrs. Erlinda A. Frany, Mrs. Mary Finela M. Bayan, Mrs. Teodora D. Vitug, and Mrs. Editha P. Mendoza, EdD. At present, Carmen National High School is under the leadership of Ma’am Jesusa D. Bote, CESE.
