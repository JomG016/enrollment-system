            <div class="scrollcontent custom-scroll">
             Carmen National High School was established on June 30, 1978 through the collective efforts of the members of the Sangguniang Bayan, spearheaded by Mr. Renato Cabacungan, the dynamic school head at that time. Strong support was extended by then Mayor Francisco Ramirez, who provided significant leadership and encouragement to the group working toward the establishment of a secondary school for the benefit of the Carmenian community and neighboring areas. Mr. Laureano Candelaria likewise rendered invaluable and unwavering support in the founding of the school.
Carmen National High School was the last barangay high school approved by the former Director of the Department of Education, Region III, Mr. Robinson Ylagan. During its initial years, the salaries of the teachers were funded by former Mayor Francisco Ramirez. The school began operations offering only first- and second-year levels, with an initial enrollment of seventy-eight (78) students.
Upon its opening, the school was temporarily housed within the compound of Carmen Elementary School. Several individuals expressed interest in leading the newly established institution; however, in the interest of the school, its students, and the community, former Mayor Ramirez and Mr. Renato Cabacungan agreed that the most dedicated and capable individual should be appointed. Consequently, Mr. Renato Cabacungan, then Principal of Carmen Elementary School, was designated as Assistant Principal under the supervision of the Principal of its mother school, Zaragoza National High School.
The pioneering teachers of the school were Mrs. Epifania G. Caparas, Miss Minda C. Gallardo, Mrs. Julieta E. Morales, Mrs. Leonora L. Ledesma, Mrs. Juliana B. Bernardino, Mrs. Felicidad D.C. Carlos, Mrs. Elenita Vanzuela, Mr. Rizaldy Santiago, Mr. Romeo Siblag, and Mr. Norberto M. Calma. Serving as honorary English teachers were Mr. Renato Cabacungan, Mr. Godofredo Galvan, Mr. Antonio Padunan, Mrs. Julieta E. Mendez, and Mrs. Arceli Candelaria. By School Year 1979–1980, all year levels of the secondary school were fully established.
As the years passed, student enrollment steadily increased, necessitating the hiring of additional teaching staff. In 1987, Mrs. Nila Mactal was appointed School Principal, followed by Mr. Quirino Guevarra, an English Division Supervisor, who served as Officer-in-Charge. From 1989 to 1994, Mrs. Gloria Gabriel, Assistant Principal of Zaragoza National High School, assumed the role of Officer-in-Charge.
When the school became a provincial high school, teachers were tasked with collecting tuition fees from students to fund their salaries. In many cases, payment was deferred until after harvest seasons, reflecting the economic realities of the community. Shortly thereafter, the Nationalization Act for all secondary schools in the Philippines was implemented.
Subsequently, plans were made to transfer the school to its permanent site, where it currently stands. A 5,700-square-meter lot was generously donated by the philanthropic Tecson family. The relocation process was challenging, as teachers and students worked together to clear the land, which was initially occupied by several residential structures. Former Mayor Lydia R. Pagaduan played a crucial role in facilitating negotiations and persuading occupants to relocate for the greater good of present and future students from Carmen and nearby communities. Voluntary contributions were also collected to assist families in transferring to other locations, paving the way for the construction of the school buildings now known as Carmen National High School.
Over the years, the school has been led by a succession of dedicated and dynamic principals, namely: Mrs. Nenita E. Masibay, Dr. Monica Mallari, Miss Leonila E. Jacinto, Dr. Elpidia R. Andres, Mr. Norberto M. Calma, Mrs. Erlinda A. Frany, Mrs. Mary Finela M. Bayan, Mrs. Teodora D. Vitug, and Mrs. Editha P. Mendoza, EdD. At present, Carmen National High School is under the leadership of Ma’am Jesusa D. Bote, CESE.

            <div class="scrollcontent custom-scroll">
             This website was developed by Jomari Gonzales, the Leader of Group 1 (Research), as part of an academic and research-oriented project. The development process officially started on December 19, 2025 and was successfully completed on February 7, 2026. Throughout this period, careful planning, design, and implementation were carried out to ensure the website met both technical and presentation standards.

The website was built using modern front-end web development technologies, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for structuring content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript (JS) for interactivity and dynamic functionality. These technologies were chosen to create a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly experience across different devices and screen sizes.

To support backend-related features without building a traditional server, the project utilized BaaS (Backend as a Service) solutions. This approach allowed for efficient data handling, authentication, and service integration while keeping the development process streamlined. In addition, Git was used as a backend and version-control tool to track changes, manage updates, and maintain project stability throughout development.

The website was deployed using Vercel, a cloud-based deployment platform known for its speed, reliability, and seamless integration with modern web projects. Vercel enabled fast builds, automatic deployments, and consistent performance for end users.

For the visual and user-interface design, tools such as Canva and Figma were used during the planning and design stages. These tools helped in creating wireframes, layouts, and visual assets, ensuring a clean, organized, and visually appealing design that aligns with modern web standards.

Overall, this website represents a combination of research-driven development, modern web technologies, and thoughtful design, showcasing both technical skills and collaborative leadership in a structured academic project.
